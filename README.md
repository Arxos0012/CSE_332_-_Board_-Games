# CSE 332 - Board Games

This is a project developed during my Object-Oriented Software Development Laboratory class at Washington University in St Louis. It has three games to play: Tic-Tac-Toe, Gomoku, and Sudoku. To choose which game to play simply build the program and enter following on the command line:

$ <program_name> <game_mode>

where game_mode can be "TicTacToe", "Gomoku", or "Sudoku". Each game tells players how to play, and games can be saved and played later. Have fun!
